## About
  This project is a front-end application for an "IMDB clone" database for JMU's CS 474 Databases class.
A majority of the semester was spent creating the database schema, ER diagram and then the actual database of an IMDB clone database.
For the last couple weeks of the semester for the final part of the project we were given roughly two weeks to implement a frontend application for the IMDB clone interface.

  The project is built in Java Swing and uses JDBC, this language and technology was chosen as the comfort level amongst all team members is well with Java Swing.
